I had the funniest dream last night.
You guys know I love my dreams...
...this might be the best dream I've ever had.
Best dream I've had in the past few years, for sure.
Anyway. I was in my elementary school cafeteria...
...a lot of my dreams take place there. I don't know why.
But I was in my elementary school cafeteria.
Everyone from my life was there.
You guys were there. My coworkers were there. All my friends were there.
It was a nice sunny day, and we were all eating lunch.
The cafeteria had two pipes coming into it---
big pipes, like a foot in diameter.
One pipe was green, and was piping cooked rice into a trough.
The other was blue, and was piping beans into another trough.
Everyone was making platefuls of rice and beans from the troughs.
The atmosphere was generally happy and joyful.
The sun was shining, people were laughing and getting along.
But then the tone shifted.
Slowly, a chant started to build.
Quiet at first, but soon enough it became clear:
"Green blast brown! Green blast brown! GREEN BLAST BROWN!"
Suddenly, there was a deep rumbling from the green pipe...
...and it started spewing poop everywhere!
On top of that, everyone was cheering!
The food trough was ruined, and there was poop splattered all over the walls, and yet everyone was cheering.
Soon enough, everyone settled down, and things went back to normal.
But then, sure enough, the chant started again...
"Blue blast brown! Blue blast brown! BLUE BLAST BROWN!"
You can guess what happed from there.
